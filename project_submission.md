# Project Submission
You will write server-side code to store a list of your favorite movies, including box art imagery and a movie trailer URL. You will then serve this data as a web page allowing visitors to review their movies and watch the trailers.

# Evaluation
Your project will be evaluated by a Udacity Code Reviewer according to the rubric below. Be sure to review it thoroughly before you submit. All criteria must "meet specifications" in order to pass. Furthermore a code reviewer has posted [their pre-submission checklist](https://discussions.udacity.com/t/project-1-checklist-read-this-before-you-submit-your-project/39852) on the forums, refer to it for even more detail on what reviewers look for in a project.
